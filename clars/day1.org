** Part One
*** Problem
This problem asks me to find two numbers in ~input~ that sum up to 2020.
*** Solution
It is easy to solve this problem naively. Just iterate through the sequence of numbers twice. This solution, however, has \(O(N^2)\). In order to make it more efficient I can use hashmap.

First, I store ~2020 - number~ as key and the index of the number as value by iterating through the sequence. Second, check if a number in the sequence is in the key and the index of the number and the value-index is not the same. This operations is seeing if the two numbers are different and sum up to 2020.

Each of these operations takes \(O(N)\), so the total time is \(O(N)\).
*** Code
This is my [[../codes/day1/src/main.rs][original code]].

You'll get the answer, ~1007331~.
