** Part One
*** Problem
This problem asks me to count a character in a string.
*** Solution
If a password has specified number of the character, then it's valid; otherwise invalid.

Repeat this procedure until the end of the file and count how many of those strings are valid.
*** Answer
#+begin_src shell
bazel run //main:solve
#+end_src
Iâ€™ve got the answer, ~393~.

** Part Two
*** Problem
This problem is also asking me to count a character in a string, but this time, it's just two positions.
*** Solution
If a password has an exactly one character in two positions in the string, then it's valid; otherwise invalid.

This is like an XOR operation. Check the string has the character at ~A~ position XOR ~B~ position.
*** Answer
#+begin_src shell
bazel run //main:solve
#+end_src
I've got the answer, ~690~.
